# HTML5 Canvas Platformer

Starter kit for a platformer using HTML5 canvas API and WebSockets

## To play:

Run `npm start`, and point your browser to `localhost:3001`.

To play on a keyboard, use the arrows to move around, space to jump.

Or, to use your phone as a controller: with your browser open to `localhost:3001`, point your phone's browser to the local IP address shown in your terminal (above `localhost`, and including the `/player` endpoint). This will open a controller on your phone.
